# FoodMe: Connecting Communities Through Technology

FoodMe is a mobile application that addresses food insecurity by connecting food suppliers with underserved communities, earning recognition as a Google Solutions Challenge Global Top 100 winner from over 2,000+ international submissions.

## The Challenge

Food waste and food insecurity exist simultaneously - millions of pounds of food are wasted while communities struggle with hunger. Traditional food redistribution systems are often inefficient, lacking real-time coordination between suppliers and those in need.

## The Solution

FoodMe creates a seamless platform that:

- **Real-time matching** between food suppliers and community organizations
- **Geographic optimization** to minimize travel and maximize impact  
- **Inventory management** for suppliers to easily list available food
- **Community coordination** for organizations to claim and distribute food
- **Impact tracking** to measure redistribution success

## Technical Implementation

### Mobile-First Design
- **React Native** for cross-platform compatibility
- **Firebase** for real-time data synchronization
- **Google Maps integration** for location-based matching
- **Push notifications** for immediate coordination

### Backend Infrastructure  
- **Node.js API** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Google Cloud Platform** for scalable hosting
- **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management
- **Real-time database** for instant updates

### Impact Optimization
- **Algorithm-based matching** considering distance, quantity, and urgency
- **Analytics dashboard** for tracking redistribution metrics
- **Community feedback system** for continuous improvement

## Recognition & Impact

### Google Solutions Challenge Success
- **Global Top 100** selection from 2,000+ international teams
- **1 of only 3 US teams** to achieve this recognition
- **Georgetown University** featured the achievement prominently

### Technical Excellence
- **Scalable architecture** ready for nationwide deployment
- **User-centered design** optimized for both suppliers and communities
- **Real-world impact** addressing genuine food security challenges

## Key Learnings

1. **Social impact through technology** - How thoughtful design can address real-world problems
2. **Cross-platform development** - Building mobile experiences that work everywhere
3. **Global competition experience** - Presenting technical solutions to international judges
4. **Team collaboration** - Leading development across a 4-person multidisciplinary team
