overview: >
  Delivered a Git-independent sharing platform used by 2,000+ internal users in 10 weeks.
  Reduced a 9-click workflow to a single action by rethinking the UX, hardening APIs,
  and automating policy-driven cleanup. Led end-to-end executionâ€”from user research
  and requirements to full-stack implementation, testing, and production release, 
  improving reliability, adoption, and developer velocity.

buildNotes:
  - "Designed Git-independent sharing to unblock non-technical stakeholders; cut friction by 89%."
  - "Implemented full-stack sharing and automated cleanup (JWT-secured), deployed via Docker/Kubernetes."
  - "Owned delivery: wrote tickets, ran demos, and iterated from concept to production."
